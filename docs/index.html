        <tr><td>2.0.4.0: </td><td style="text-align:left"> 
            <ol type="1">
                <li> Pegasus seems to be crashing when an unexpected BLE device is connected. Instead of crashing, hopefully we will now show a warning message instead.
                </li>
                <li> Removed operations from receiving email reports of crashes from Pegasus, because they were getting too many.
                </li>
                <li> Added Lots of little checks in places where Pegasus reported that it is crashing. Some of the crash reports were vague, so this will be a game of whack-a-mole.
                </li>
                <li> Replaced all calls to fatalerror with displaying a modal warning message.
                </li>
            </ol></td></tr>

        <tr><td>2.0.3.2: </td><td style="text-align:left"> 
            <ol type="1">
                <li> Fixed a huge memory leak that was allocating around a hundred megabytes of memory 
                    every time the user would go to a new screen from the main screen.
                </li>
                <li> Fixed problems when running on the iPhone (not iPad). Fixed button text to fit the smaller buttons. 
                    For some reason the back button was not showing for some of the new the SwiftUI views.
                    I had to explicitly make the back button show on these views in the code. 
                    Previously you just got stuck on these screens and would have to restart Pegasus.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    When we go to the GPS status view, we now periodically get a new bluetooth signal strength RSSI from the BLE radio. 
                    This display updates once every 5 seconds and it animates when the update happens.
                </li>
                <li> 
                  Lots of code cleanup around the new smart print method that can automatically 
                  log to the new console view which can be dynamically turned on or off by the user.
                </li>
            </ol></td></tr>

        <tr><td>2.0.3.1: </td><td style="text-align:left"> 
            <ol type="1">
                <li> Fixed a bug in the previous release that was causing a crash.
                </li>
            </ol></td></tr>

        <tr><td>2.0.3.0: </td><td style="text-align:left"> 
            <ol type="1">
                <li>When Pegasus Crashes, we now are saving the crash log. When Pegasus restarts, we upload the crashlog to S3 and send out emails to notify Pegasus developer.
                </li>
                <li>Added a library to allow the user to view the debug console. Can be dynamically shown or hidden from the the right hand settings menu. 
                    This may be useful for debugging some run time issues such as whether or no a cable is connected.
                </li>
            </ol></td></tr>

        <tr><td>2.0.2.9: </td><td style="text-align:left"> 
            <ol type="1">
                <li>We are now logging a whole bunch of state variables to help us further track down what is going wrong with the laggy GPS reception from Falcon to Pegasus.
                    When the pilot goes to the submit flight report screen, we stop the logger and zip the log file and upload it to data-acq's S3 bucket. 
                </li>
            </ol></td></tr>


        <tr><td>2.0.2.8: </td><td style="text-align:left"> 
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Added CPU and temperature monitor, which can be shown or hidden from the settings sidebar. 
                    The purpose of this is to try and get to the bottom of what is causing laggy / stuttery behavior for pilots when flying over fields.</li>
            </ol></td></tr>

        <tr><td>2.0.2.7: </td><td style="text-align:left"> 
            <ol type="1">
                <li>The values in the advanced settings page were not being saved correctly. This should now be fixed.</li>
                <li>The variable in advanced settings GPS Heading Samples now correctly applies a variable weighted 
                    averaging filter to the heading which gets displayed to the pilot. The filter can be 2 to 25 samples, 
                    which corresponds to 200milliseconds to 2.5 seconds of averaging the headings together, weighting the most
                    recent heading twice as much as the oldest heading.
                </li>
                <li>Lots of reorganization and code cleanup for parts of the code that have not been touched in several years.</li>

            </ol></td></tr>

        <tr><td>2.0.2.6: </td><td style="text-align:left"> 
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Fixed a bug that was causing a crash when submitting a flight report if there was no pilot selected.</li>
                <li>The back button was hidden for some reason on iPhones for the GPS Screen and the Camera info screen. 
                    It should now be showing.</li>
                <li>Now using pass speed and transit speed as two separate values to estimate the flight plan length. 
                    These are now setable via two sliders on the flight planning screen.</li>
                <li>Now measuring pass speed and transit speed as two separate values and submitting them with the flight report.</li>
                <li>Now pulling pass speed and transit speed from the Ceres Works API on per pilot / per aircraft basis.</li>
                <li>User now must select an aircraft and pilot after choosing a flight plan.</li>
